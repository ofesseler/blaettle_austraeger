# Blättle Austräger

Since it is a very hard thing to ask from companies to provide services that are accessible I decided to create a little script in order to help the Nussbaum Verlag to provive a feaible way to download a PDF from a website for blind people. This is necessary due to the inability to use their website with VoiceOver. 

```shell
npx playwright test
```

Make sure you installed all dependencies with 
```shell
npm install
```

If you are someone from Nussbaum and interested in details feel free to contact me.
