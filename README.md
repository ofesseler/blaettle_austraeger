Since it is a very hard thing to ask from companies to provide services that are accessible I decided to create a little script in order to help the Nussbaum Verlag to provive a feasible way to download a PDF from a website for blind people. This is necessary due to the inability to use their website with VoiceOver. 

**Update 2025-06-11**
The site was redesigned and got some A11y features. 
They made a huge step from literaly unaccessible to hard to navigate. 
Since Accessability is more then some `aria` tags and passed tests, this project continues.


```shell
npx playwright test
```

Make sure you installed all dependencies with 
```shell
npm install
```

If you are someone from Nussbaum and interested in details feel free to contact me. 

To use your credentials create an `.env` file according to the sample `.env.sample`.
